Simple Python script to send reminder emails from XMPP

Build

To build debian package run

$ dpkg-deb --build prosody-emailremindercomponent-0.0.1/

Setup

/etc/prosody/emailreminder/config.yml

First of all copy the config_example.yml to config.yml in the same directory. The example config is commented and should be easy to set up

/etc/prosody/conf.d/emailreminder.cfg.lua

Component name and secret MUST match the values in config.yml

Now restart both prosody and emailreminder

$ sudo service restart emailremindercomponent
$ sudo service restart prosody

If you get problems set the logging_level in config.yml to debug, this will produce output from the script as well as smtplib.
Check the log file at /var/log/prosody/emailremindercomponent.log

Use

Send message to jid set in config files. This will trigger send an email using the account in the config file to the mapped email address with the subject "Reminder <date" and the message. I use emails as reminders all the time and wanted to quicker way to send them. If your JID is setup in the email address mapping, you will get a reminder set / reminder failed confirmation message back. If no email mapping exists, no email or reply is sent.
